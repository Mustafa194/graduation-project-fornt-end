            In the name of God, we have created a website where projects from
            previous years can be stored. Through this website, students will
            benefit greatly by viewing projects from previous years so that they
            can clarify their needs in their department or obtain information or
            receive new ideas and innovations for their final project. This
            website consists of several pages that are divided into two
            sections, the user section and the admin section. In the user
            section, students can visit the website and learn about the website
            and all the projects and a brief about Salahaddin University. In the
            admin department, the coordinator is responsible for adding new
            projects and organizing them in an appropriate way so that students
            can get the most out of it in the easiest way.
